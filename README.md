This file was written by Kevin O'Connor and Allison Hwang as part of the 2015 Atomic Games hosted by Atomic Object.  It implements a smart heuristic algorithm for determining the next ideal move in a game of Othello.  This algorithm takes into account how many points can be gained, how many open moves it leaves for the player as well as the opponent, and whether any corners can be taken.
